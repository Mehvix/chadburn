#### *A private a secure messaging service*

> ## Inspiration
> We wanted to create a way to privately communicate without companies or government organizations having access to your data (especially with recent events that  have been occurring).

> ## What it does
> Users can create private chatrooms by setting a one-word phrase (think of this as the chat room name), password, and expiration date. The chatroom is then created, and anyone else with the correct phrase and password can decrypt, read, and send messages. 

> ## How we built it
> We used HTML/CSS/JS for the front-end and PHP and MySQL for the back-end.

> ## Challenges we ran into
> PHP

> ## Accomplishments that we're proud of
> Both of us are proud of picking up PHP/MySQL during the hackathon. This is also my (Emily) first hackathon, and first time I've worked on a project at this pace/scale. I'm used to working slowly and improving by code little by little, so this was "unsailed waters" for me :) 

> ## What we learned
> I (Emily) learned that I should keep my code organized when I'm writing it so I don't have to go back and fix it later. It was hard for me to go back and make changes because I kept writing new classes to display the conditions I wanted it to have.
> I (Max) learned all about the ups-and-downs PHP and MySQL, but it was a rewarding experience. I've done a lot of algos/scripts before this, so working on a webapp was a new (and rewarding) project. 

> ## What's next for Chadburn
> Realistically, we are both going to take a break and get some sleep right after I finished writing this; however, we're both interested in polishing a couple of features added towards the end and continuing to maintain this into the future
